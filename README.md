# üëã Hi there, I'm Ryan Sholin!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about leveraging technology, sustainability, and strategic consulting to make a meaningful impact on the world.

## üåç About Me

- **Consulting**: I'm experienced in product, partnerships, sales, and customer success. Now I'm helping businesses align their strategies with sustainable practices through [Overt Impact](https://overtimpact.io)
- **Sustainability Advocate**: With a focus on climate and sustainability, I'm exploring the intersection of **AI**, **sustainability**, and **energy efficiency**. I'm particularly interested in both the compliance side of corporate sustainability reporting and the technical side of making data centers more energy efficient to fight climate change.
- **Content Person**: My first roles in technology were in newsrooms, and later at newspaper companies. I've been [blogging](https://ryansholin.com) since 2005, often on topics related to media, communication, and the news business. I was more active on social media earlier in my career, and I was responsible for helping many US newspapers get their first accounts set up on Twitter, Facebook, and even MySpace. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansholin) is where I'm most active today. You should follow me there.
- **Past Employers**: You might know me from Automattic (WordPress VIP), Gannett, GateHouse Media, or Chalkbeat.
